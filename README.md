## 👨‍💻 **Team Details**

**Project Title:** GarbiScan – AI-Powered Garbage Monitoring System  
**Team Members:**  
- Mehak Malhotra  
- Himanshu Dhall  
- Aarav Chugh  

**Faculty Coordinator:** Dr. Rakhi Nagpal  
**Institute:** Chitkara University Institute of Engineering and Technology, Punjab

## 🧠 **Problem Statement**

Traditional garbage monitoring is:
- ⏱️ Time-consuming and labor-intensive  
- ⚠️ Prone to human error  
- 🗑️ Lacking real-time tracking, causing delayed cleaning and hygiene issues  

**Hence, there’s an urgent need for automation in waste monitoring systems.**

---

## 💡 **Proposed Solution**

**GarbiScan** uses **AI and computer vision** to:
- Continuously monitor garbage levels using CCTV footage  
- Allow administrators to select specific areas and define **threshold limits**  
- Automatically trigger **alerts** when thresholds are crossed  
- Provide real-time insights to ensure faster and smarter waste management  

This results in **improved operational efficiency** and **reduced manual oversight**.

## 🧩 **System Flow**

1. CCTV captures live footage  
2. Frames are processed via the YOLO model (Object Detection)  
3. Garbage accumulation levels are analyzed  
4. Threshold comparisons trigger alerts when necessary  
5. Admin dashboard updates in real-time with actionable data
